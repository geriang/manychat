property purchased.

Housing Developers refer to entities in the business of housing development (i.e. construction and sale of housing units) with respect to the subject property acquired.
(Note: This definition of Housing Developer is the condensed version. You may refer to paragraph (1) of Article 3 to the Stamp Duties Act for the full definition.)

All entities will be subject to the new ABSD rate of 65%. Housing developers are subject to the ABSD rate of 35% and
an additional non-remittable ABSD rate of 5% upon stamping, i.e. aggregate ABSD rate of 40%. Such developers may
apply for upfront remission on the ABSD rate of 35% under the Stamp Duties (Non-Licensed Housing Developers)
(Remission of ABSD) Rules and the Stamp Duties (Housing Developers) (Remission of ABSD) Rules3
(collectively referred to as “ABSD Housing Developers Remission”).

Entities who are acquiring residential properties with no intention to undertake housing development of the subject
property acquired should pay the ABSD rate of 65%.

It is important for the purchasing entity to decide whether it will undertake housing development of the subject property
at the point of purchase, in order to ascertain the ABSD treatment. Any subsequent change of intention will not be
considered for stamp duty purposes. For example, entities who paid the ABSD rate of 65% will not qualify for the ABSD
Housing Developers Remission, even if they fulfil the remission conditions subsequently.

2.3 All buyers / transferees (i.e. individuals, entities, housing developers) are required to complete the ABSD
Declaration Form to be witnessed by their lawyers (if applicable). The completed form need not be submitted to
IRAS, unless requested.
